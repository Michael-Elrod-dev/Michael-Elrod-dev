## ABOUT ME
* My name is Michael Elrod and I’m a Senior Computer Science Major at Clemson University.
I am proficient in Python, C/C++, and Java. This past summer I worked as a Software Developer at
BlueCross BlueShield of SC creating and maintaining new features for their clients’ contact centers. My
main interests are in application development both on mobile and desktop. Through my studies at
Clemson, I have also found an emerging passion for AI and machine learning topics. I often prefer
working on the backend since my interests lie with the underlying systems at work. Some of my favorite
projects I’ve worked on have been creating two different game engines in my free time to learn more
about developing interactive software.
*Currently I am collaborating with the team at BRIEF to create a STEMfocused educational app for students.
