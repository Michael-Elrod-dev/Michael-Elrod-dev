## ABOUT ME
Hey! I'm Michael, a software developer at Scientific Research Corporation with a master's in CS from Clemson. I work on full-stack defense applications during the day and build indie games at night.
Most of my public repos are personal projects or AI related research. I'm into AI/ML, game engine architecture, and pretty much anything that involves building something cool from the ground up.
Feel free to poke aroundâ€”always happy to chat about code, games, or interesting problems.
