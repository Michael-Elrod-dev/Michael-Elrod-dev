## ABOUT ME
* Hello! I'm Michael Elrod, a Senior Computer Science Major at Clemson University, proficient in Python, C/C++, and Java. This past summer, I honed my skills as a Software Developer at BlueCross BlueShield of SC, engaging in the creation and maintenance of new features for client contact centers. However, my true passion resides with artificial intelligence and machine learning.

* My journey through Clemson has ignited a growing enthusiasm for AI and ML, leading me to delve into areas like reinforcement learning, regression model creation and optimal path finding algorithms. I have a particular interest in autonomous vehicles, often finding myself drawn to backend development to better grasp the underlying systems in play. In my free time, I’ve embarked on crafting two distinct game engines, broadening my understanding of interactive software development.

* Recently, my endeavors have led me to a thrilling project that aims at automating drones to act as pollinators, employing the core principles of AI and ML. This initiative not only aligns with my academic pursuits but also harbors the potential to contribute to ecological sustainability.

* Alongside, I'm collaborating with the visionary team at BRIEF to develop a STEM-centric educational app, aspiring to make learning an engaging and insightful experience for students.

* I am currently a senior, but post spring, I will continue for one more year to obtain my Master’s degree, further enriching my knowledge and capabilities in the vast field of computer science.
