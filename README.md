## ABOUT ME
* My name is Michael Elrod, and Iâ€™m a Senior Computer Science Major at Clemson University. I am proficient in Python, C/C++, and Java. This past summer, I worked as a Software Developer at BlueCross BlueShield of SC, where I was involved in creating and maintaining new features for their clients' contact centers. My main interests lie in artificial intelligence & machine learning.
* Through my studies at Clemson, I have developed a growing passion for AI and machine learning topics. I often prefer working on the backend, as my interests lie in understanding the underlying systems at work. Some of my favorite projects involve creating two different game engines in my spare time to learn more about developing interactive software.
* Currently, I am collaborating with the team at BRIEF to create a STEM-focused educational app for students.
